## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already read, and eat fairly healthy, though I could do more of both. This article made me go buy walnuts (supposedly a brain food).

I definitely need to incorporate more breaks into my coding.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

p "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

#, the 'octothorpe'

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

A float has a decimal point, unlike an integer.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

p animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

p "My favorite animal is a #{animal}"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

string.split splits a string into words based on spaces. If you add an argument, i.e. .split("-") it will split based on that character instead.

string.gsub(phrase, replacement) substitutes all instances of a phrase with another phrase
