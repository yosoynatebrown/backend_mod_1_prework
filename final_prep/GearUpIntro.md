**What were your reflections from the video?**

- Unconscious bias is universal -- something we all need to work on. Those of us with privilege need to be even more aware
of our unconscious biases, since those biases can have an outsized impact. It was eye opening to understand the effects of neurodiversity and disability on participation in the tech industry, on top of the more widely known effects of misogyny and racism on hiring.

**In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?**

- Growing up in a church that accepted people of all genders and sexual orientations exposed me to a diversity of people. Doing standup comedy widened that circle further. It's helped me in attempting to be more conscious of my reactions to people of different backgrounds, though there is always progress to be made (for everyone).

**What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?**

- I'm interested in writing software that might, in some small way, mitigate the effects of climate change. An awareness of environmental racism, as well as the largely disparate impacts of climate change on low-lying, developing nations will, I hope, inform my approach to writing that software. Climate change will not affect everyone equally, and our approach to combating it should reflect that.

**When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?**
- As a straight white male, noticing my privileges is a little more difficult than if I were in a different demographic. But talking with friends and roommates has opened my eyes to some of these hidden advantages. I can walk around the park without being hassled, unlike my female roommate. Likewise, I can feel safe walking around our neighborhood at 11 PM. I can have people not talk over me, or assume I don't know what I'm talking about. The list goes on.

**What strengths does your identity give you? How will you utilize those at Turing?**
- I'll have an advantage in hiring if companies are implicitly biased toward white male candidates. After getting my foot in the door, I plan to make it a priority to recommend qualified women and candidates of color who I know from Turing (or elsewhere).

-   I also grew up with computers in the home, which gave me a headstart/made me a bit of a digital native. I'll use whatever knowledge I have to help others grasp what we're learning.

**How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?**
- Making sure to declare my pronouns. Not talking over women or people of color (or anyone else for that matter). Going out of my way to ask people from those groups for their opinions if they haven't been able to get a word in.
- Hosting comedy open mics, I put women, POC, and LGBT comedians up earlier on the list. Mostly, to keep them wanting to come back. But in part because 20 white male perspectives in a row is boring.

**How will your strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?**
- I feel comfortable in diverse spaces, and will try to use that comfort to bridge gaps between various sorts of people. As I said, I also want to make it a point to ask teammates for their opinion if they haven't gotten a chance to say what they're thinking.
